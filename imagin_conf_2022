## Nearmap Aerial Imagery
Cool stuff with 3D aerial imagery   
3D vector buildings, can be generated from 3d aerial imagery
Digital surface model - photogrametry   
Ground is leveraging a DEM
### Machine Learning & AI
Began rolling out to market about 4 years ago.   
Bexar County Apprasisal District - 242.8% return on investment - ROI.  

## Kate Berg Streamlining Workflows EGLE
- Drinking water concerns system

- 

## Postgres & PostGIS & GISSquirrel
- Powerful indexing, similar to MicrosoftSQL Server

- ST_ functions
- GIS Sq has a free trial
- It just works in QGIS, but folks much more familiar with ESRI
### How do we use it?
- Setup => Linux server, Postgres, PostGIS, ArcMap,
- Also using PyCharm quite a bit
- Feature Service and Postgres are connected directly, edit and update feature service automatically
### Update Buildings
- ogr2ogr works very quickly
- Using to GeoJSON conversion, but could use 
### pg tileserv

### ESRI Imagery Workflows
- Imagery is a Foundational Source of Information
- Web Services/Image Services
- More happening on the client in AGOL
- ArcGIS Living Atlas of the World
- Sentinel-2 Views: all of the sentinel 2 images
- NAIP, temporal & event imagery

- ArcGIS Image Dedicated: Azure, AWS,
- ESRI managed Imagery Services for your S3 bucket
- Hosting, analysis and streaming
- Stream your imagery as tiled dynamic services
- AGOL will automatically generate a mosaic from your images
- Scalable imagery processing, specify credit limit per user
- Upload and publish imagery, select the type of image service, add analytics, 150 raster function templates, 
- Deep Learning workflows: AI team, analytics team, pre-made models, can customize,
- Does require a special license to create the products
### Map Viewer
- New map viewer does not yet have imagery analysis tools
- DONT EVER CLICK THIS BUTTON
- Burn severity tool, opens a model builder type interface`
- NAIP imagery time slider    
- 1.2 credits per gig/month, will show credits first, 11 credits for Mackinac Is. building
## MSP GIS
- 100 Emergency Managers in the state, 83 counties and 17 municipalities
- 136 Total members, one crator for eaxh municipality

### Data COllection
- Previously using paper field survey collections, GPS?  Camera?
- Huge amount of work
- Survey123 App, automatically transfers to the cloud
- Manually entering GPS, sometimes using location gets messy, start from at HQ

**Generate reports directly from Dashboard/Survey?   
Leverage ArcGIS Python API for uploading?   
Use imagery hosted from other sources?   
Only consume credits when processing imagery? - YES**
