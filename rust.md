PMTiles is the foundation of the Protomaps open source project – an ecosystem 
of tools, libraries and data for geospatial visualization. 
Protomaps publishes its datasets to Source Cooperative, and helps 
organizations of all sizes transition to cloud-native mapping. 
It’s supported through commercial development projects, a fellowship through 
the Cloud-Native Geospatial Foundation, and GitHub Sponsors. You can learn more 
at protomaps.com.
