GeoParquet is a file format & GeoArrow is a memory format.
GeoP savd to disk while Arrow is deserialized GeoP file into memory.
Both are columnar formats, data by column instead of row.


PMTiles is the foundation of the Protomaps open source project – an ecosystem 
of tools, libraries and data for geospatial visualization. Protomaps publishes 
its datasets to Source Cooperative, and helps organizations of all sizes 
transition to cloud-native mapping. It’s supported through commercial 
development projects, a fellowship through the Cloud-Native Geospatial 
Foundation, and GitHub Sponsors. You can learn more at protomaps.com.
