Some opportunities for implementation of the Complete Streets Policy. 
Difficulty with internal committment, policy developed in a vacuum. 
In Staff trainings, workshops. Street Design manual also in need of an update.
Metrics and design, look at the metrics of our CS Policy, how often do we
report? 

Clear metrics: crash numbers, injuries/deaths, air pollutions reduction
sidewalks, bike lanes built,
Last update in 1998, in need of a major update. IMAGINE KZOO 2035. 
Multi-modal level of service, auto trips generated, policy update to City
Comission for updated approval.   
Only one committee in Joplin, MO for CS. Perhaps formalize the CSAC, make
it an official committee of the city.   
What is the process for adoption by the City?
Is CSAC the mouthpiece for some of the new street design projects?
We do not have counters for the bike lanes.    
Horrendously bad road design of the past.  PR Firm hired to help advertise the
road design issues.  Neighborhood representative
