# 30DayMapChallenge2023
## Let's Map, Build & Learn
I've decided to spend 30 days learning GeoRust!   
[https://georust.org/](https://georust.org/)
### Project Strategy
Still trying to learn more about rust and exactly what I should attempt to build
during the challenge.  Could possibly build an API or service that is serving
up transit data, possibly a wrapper on top of transit.land GTFS datasets?
Would also like to leverage GeoParquet & GeoArrow for fast data transfer and
loading, deck.gl for efficient visualization of this data.  Also curious about
the rustlibre-gl mapping library local demo.  Possibility of serving up OSM
data or ProtoMaps Tiles for custom basemaps...  Also some type of online rust 
GIS using the whitebox tools?
Next steps:
1. Learn and code more rust with the learn rust in 30 minutes site
2. Try some of the examples at GeoRust
3. Experiment with Polars/GeoPolars with real data!
4. Possibly contact Kyle Barron to see which project I could contribute to.
### Notes
- Installing Rust
- Traits: adding methods to existing types
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
proceed with default installation
To get started you may need to restart your current shell.
This would reload your PATH environment variable to include
Cargo's bin directory ($HOME/.cargo/bin).
```
- from web:
> build your project with cargo build   
> run your project with cargo run   
> test your project with cargo test   
> build documentation for your project with cargo doc   
> publish a library to crates.io with cargo publish   
> To test that you have Rust and Cargo installed, you can run this in your terminal of choice:   
> cargo --version
```bash
cargo --version
# cargo 1.73.0 (9c4383fb5 2023-08-26)
cargo new thirty-day-map-2023
# Created binary (application) `thirty-day-map-2023` package
# Installed rust-analyzer in Mason
cargo run
# Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
# Running `target/debug/thirty-day-map-2023`
# Hello, world!
```
adding dependencies
installed taplo toml LSP
```toml
[dependencies]
ferris-says = "0.3.1"
```
```bash
cargo build
```
To use this dependency, we can open main.rs, remove everything that’s in there (it’s just another example), and add this line to it:
```rust 
use ferris_says::say;
```
This line means that we can now use the say function that the ferris-says crate exports for us.
   
### Testing small rust application
```rust
use ferris_says::say; // from the previous step
use std::io::{stdout, BufWriter};

fn main() {
    let stdout = stdout();
    let message = String::from("Hello fellow Rustaceans!");
    let width = message.chars().count();

    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(stdout.lock());
    say(&message, width, &mut writer).unwrap();
}
```
```bash
cargo run
 __________________________
< Hello fellow Rustaceans! >
 --------------------------
        \

            _~^~^~_
        \) /  o o  \ (/
          '_   -   _'
          / '-----' \

```

OK that was fun!
First rust lang prog, easy to install rust and cargo,
build dependencies, run program.
Now working here with the GeoRust book - https://book.georust.org/youre-projecting.html
Added dependencies to same main.rs file
Download like 40 crates!
```bash
# toml 
geo = "0.21.0"
proj = "0.27.0"
wkt = "0.10.3"

cargo build
# ran into an issue
cargo clean
# removed block
# check free disk space
df -h

- Looks like we need clang to make this install work
warning: `thirty-day-map-2023` (bin "thirty-day-map-2023")
generated 3 warnings (run `cargo fix --bin "thirty-day-map-2023"`
to apply 3 suggestions)
- OK this is progress!
```bash
cargo fix --bin "thirty-day-map-2023" --allow-dirty
# fix stuff
- Interesting note: running cargo fix removed uneeded code so previous project 
imports were removed.
```rust
# Also able to comment out old code/dependencies and still perform cargo run.
# Nice LSP features: missing semi-colon clearly notated.
# Cargo let me know that x was unused, add an '_' to remove warning
cargo run
let _x: i32 = 42;
# just use i32 for all numbers! Rust will default to i32
let _ = 42;
# _ declares a constant
let pair = ('d', 64)
pair.0 # 'd'
# tuples, fixed length collections, rust compiler can usually infer types
let (a_char, a_num) = ('d', 64)
# tuples can be destructured, handy for function returns
fn() hi_there() {
    println!("yello")
}
# functions declared with fn, brackets indicate block scope, can type return.
fn() -> i32 get_twelve() {
    12
}
# blocks are also expressions
{
    let a = 420
    let b = 69
    a + b # this is the tail
} # returns 489
# final expression of block implicityly returned
println!(a + b) # this fails, must be string argument
pair.1 # dots are used to access methods or values
crate::file::function
# double colon is similar, but for namespaces
use std::cmp::min
# strict sourcing rules, if you don't see it, it's not available
# ! represents macro, expands to regular code at runtime

```
